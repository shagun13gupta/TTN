    <h1> Ques 9: Define Doctype</h1>
    <p>
        The <!DOCTYPE> declaration must be the very first thing in your HTML document, before the html tag.
    </p>
    <p> 
        The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not an HTML tag; it is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.
    </p>
    <p>
        By adding <!DOCTYPE> declaration in HTML documents the browser will know what type of document to expect.
