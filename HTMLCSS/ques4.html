        <h3> position: static</h3>
            Html elments are positioned static by default. Static positioned elements are not affected by the top,bottom,left and right properties. Always positioned according to the normal flow of the page.
        </p>

        <h3>
            position: relative; 
        </h3>
        <p>
            It is positioned relative to its normal position.Setting the top,right,bottom and left properties of a relatively positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position.Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.
        </p>
        <h3>
            position: fixed;
        </h3>
        <p>
            An element with this is positioned relative to the viewport it means always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. The top,right,bottom and left properties are used to position the element. A fixed element does not leaave a gap in the page .
        </p>
        <h3> 
            position: absolute;
        </h3>
        <p>
            It is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed). However if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors it uses the document body and moves along with page scrolling.
